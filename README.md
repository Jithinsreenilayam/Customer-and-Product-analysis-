This project explores the business data using SQL queries and visualizations to understand our company better. We explore which products are the most popular, how our customers behave, and where our profits come from. By analyzing this data, we can figure out which products we need to restock urgently and which customers we should focus on keeping happy. We also calculate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of our customers, which helps us plan how much we can invest in acquiring new customers. Ultimately, our goal is to use these insights to improve our inventory management, strengthen our relationships with customers, and ensure our business continues to grow.
